# Requirements for IoT Controlled Relay System

## MicroPython Libraries
# All libraries listed here are typically included with MicroPython
# No additional installation required for standard MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico W

## Core Libraries (Built-in)
# machine - Hardware control (GPIO, timers, etc.)
# network - WiFi and networking functionality  
# socket - TCP/UDP socket operations
# time - Time and timing functions
# json - JSON encoding/decoding
# gc - Garbage collection utilities

## Optional Libraries for Extended Features
# urequests - HTTP client library (for future cloud features)
# uhashlib - Hashing functions (for authentication features) 
# ucrypto - Cryptographic functions (for HTTPS support)
# uasyncio - Asynchronous programming (for concurrent operations)

## Development Tools
# Thonny IDE - Recommended for MicroPython development
# ampy - Tool for transferring files to MicroPython devices
# mpfshell - Alternative file transfer tool

## Hardware Dependencies
# Raspberry Pi Pico W with MicroPython firmware v1.19.1 or later
# Single channel relay module (5V or 3.3V compatible)
# Breadboard and jumper wires for connections

## Notes:
# - This project is designed specifically for MicroPython
# - No pip packages or external library installation required
# - All functionality uses built-in MicroPython modules
# - For production deployment, consider pre-compiling .py files to .mpy for memory efficiency
