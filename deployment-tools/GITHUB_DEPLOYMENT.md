## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**❌ Git Authentication Failed**
```bash
# Configure Git credentials
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Use GitHub CLI for authentication
gh auth login
```

**❌ Large File Warnings**
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# Remove large files from tracking
git rm --cached large-file.bin
echo "large-file.bin" >> .gitignore
```

**❌ Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Resolve conflicts manually, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

**❌ Push Rejected**
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Then push
git push origin main
```
